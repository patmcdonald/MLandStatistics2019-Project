## Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment 2019

This is my project assessment for the GMIT course 52954 Machine Learning and Statistics, as part of the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics 2018 cohort.

The project is presented in a Jupyter Notebook format, and concerns the well known [Boston House Prices dataset](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston) and will use Python packages [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/), [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

The aims of this assessment are to:

#### Describe
Using descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset.

#### Infer
Using inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that arenâ€™t. I shall explain and discuss my findings within the notebook.

#### Predict
Using the Keras Deep Learning to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset.
